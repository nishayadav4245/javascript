    <p id="girl">Educate women
        Education can help women gain the knowledge, skills, and self-confidence they need to participate in development.
        Teach advocacy skills
        Helping women learn how to use their voices to advocate for their rights can help them reach their potential.
        Challenge harmful social norms
        Working with communities, governments, and faith leaders can help challenge social norms that prevent women and girls from reaching their potential.
        Provide resources
        Providing women with access to water, sanitation, hygiene, health, nutrition, and livelihoods training can help them reach their full potential.
